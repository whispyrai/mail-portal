  <h1>Mail Portal</h1>
  <p><em>Self-hosted team email — send/receive, bulk send, and a manual AI assistant, on Cloudflare Workers + AWS SES. One brand-parameterized codebase, one isolated deploy per brand.</em></p>
</div>

A fork of [cloudflare/agentic-inbox](https://github.com/cloudflare/agentic-inbox) (Apache 2.0). Users log in with email + password, send and receive from `firstname@<brand-domain>`, do light bulk send (mail merge), and use a manually-invoked AI assistant.

This is a **shared, brand-parameterized platform**: source is shared, but each brand deploys as its own isolated Cloudflare Worker (own D1, Durable Objects, R2, KV, SES identity, secrets, and domain) via a named Wrangler environment. Brands are selected at build time with `CLOUDFLARE_ENV` - e.g. `npm run deploy:whispyr` or `npm run deploy:wiser`. Whispyr (`mail.whispyrcrm.com`) is live; Wiser (`mail.wiserchat.ai`) is isolated in `env.wiser` and follows the Wiser go-live runbook.

Design + decisions live in the second brain: the shared platform in `~/Documents/hesham-os/wiserchat/initiatives/team-mail-portal/`, Whispyr history in `~/Documents/hesham-os/whispyr-sales/initiatives/sales-mail-portal/`.

## Architecture

Single Cloudflare Worker (Hono + React Router v7 SSR). Per-mailbox state in Durable Objects (SQLite via Drizzle); attachments in R2; global users in D1. Inbound via Cloudflare Email Routing (catch-all → Worker). Outbound via AWS SES (`eu-west-2`). Threading is SES-proof via an app-controlled `References` token (SES rewrites `Message-ID`).

## Local development

```bash
npm install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars.whispyr   # for Whispyr local dev
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars.wiser     # for Wiser local dev
npm run dev:whispyr                      # Cloudflare Access is bypassed in dev; auth gate still runs
npm run dev:wiser                        # uses only .dev.vars.wiser, not the generic file
```

Do not use one generic `.dev.vars` for both brands. Wrangler loads `.dev.vars.<environment>` exclusively when it exists, which keeps local secrets isolated by brand. `npm run typecheck`, `npm run typecheck:wiser`, `npm run verify:env:whispyr`, and `npm run verify:env:wiser` should pass before deploying brand work.

## One-time Zoho import

The admin-only importer restores exported `.eml` history into a mailbox that has
already been provisioned. It preserves dates, threads, folders, and attachments;
Trash and Spam are excluded, and re-running the same export is safe.

Keep the admin password out of command arguments. Capture it with a hidden shell
prompt, export it only for the importer process, then remove it:

```bash
read -s IMPORT_PASSWORD
export IMPORT_PASSWORD
node scripts/import-zoho.mjs \
  --base https://mail.wiserchat.ai \
  --email hesham@wiserchat.ai \
  --mailbox hello@wiserchat.ai \
  --dir ./zoho-export/hello
unset IMPORT_PASSWORD
```

Repeat for `contact@wiserchat.ai`. The driver exits non-zero if any message fails. The full Wiser migration/cutover order is in [`docs/wiser-go-live-runbook.md`](docs/wiser-go-live-runbook.md).

## Deploy (production runbook — Whispyr environment)

Each brand is a named Wrangler environment in `wrangler.jsonc` (`env.whispyr`, …), deployed by baking the env at build time. The steps below are the Whispyr environment; a new brand repeats them against its own resources under a new `env.<brand>` block. Prerequisites: a Cloudflare account with `whispyrcrm.com`, and the existing AWS SES production account in `eu-west-2`.

1. **D1 database**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 create sales_portal_users --env whispyr
   ```

   Copy the returned `database_id` into `wrangler.jsonc` (`d1_databases[0].database_id`), then apply the schema:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 migrations apply sales_portal_users --env whispyr --remote
   ```

   Apply all migrations through
   `0011_create_saved_view_create_operations.sql` before deploying the current
   Worker. Migration 0010 creates the durable Agent connection-reconciliation
   outbox and lifecycle triggers required by live access revocation. Migration
   0011 adds the idempotency ledger required by saved-view creation. Apply them
   before enabling the minutely connection reconciler, five-minute inbound
   archive reconciler, and hourly AI cache-retention schedules. The application
   fails closed when required D1 authorization or reconciliation state is
   unavailable.

2. **R2 bucket**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler r2 bucket create sales-mail-portal --env whispyr
   npx wrangler r2 bucket create sales-mail-portal-preview --env whispyr
   npx wrangler r2 bucket create sales-mail-raw-archive --env whispyr
   npx wrangler r2 bucket create sales-mail-raw-archive-preview --env whispyr
   npx wrangler queues create sales-mail-inbound --env whispyr --message-retention-period-secs 1209600
   npx wrangler queues create sales-mail-inbound-dlq --env whispyr --message-retention-period-secs 1209600
   npx wrangler queues create sales-mail-inbound-parking --env whispyr --message-retention-period-secs 1209600
   ```

   `sales-mail-raw-archive` is the private authoritative copy of every accepted
   raw inbound message. The separate `sales-mail-portal-preview` attachment and
   `sales-mail-raw-archive-preview` raw-mail buckets prevent remote development
   from writing to either production bucket. The Queue graph is exactly
   `sales-mail-inbound` → `sales-mail-inbound-dlq` →
   `sales-mail-inbound-parking`, with the configured terminal parking consumer.
   All three Queues must use the locked 14-day retention.

   Raw-archive lifecycle and Bucket Lock retention are not yet product-locked.
   Before routing live mail, make that product decision, record it, obtain
   separate approval, and only then apply the selected policies. Do not copy a
   placeholder retention value into production.

   For existing Queues, inspect and correct retention before deployment:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler queues info sales-mail-inbound --env whispyr
   npx wrangler queues info sales-mail-inbound-dlq --env whispyr
   npx wrangler queues info sales-mail-inbound-parking --env whispyr
   npx wrangler r2 bucket info sales-mail-raw-archive --env whispyr
   npx wrangler r2 bucket lifecycle list sales-mail-raw-archive --env whispyr
   npx wrangler r2 bucket lock list sales-mail-raw-archive --env whispyr
   ```

   These Wrangler 4.74 commands are read-only. `queues info` confirms that each
   Queue exists, but it does not prove the locked 14-day retention or the
   deployed consumer settings. Verify retention in the Cloudflare control plane
   and verify consumer settings and edges in the rebuilt deployment artifact.
   Queue creation or updates, and any R2 lifecycle or Bucket Lock mutation, are
   separately approval-gated. After approval, existing Queue retention is set
   with:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler queues update sales-mail-inbound --env whispyr --message-retention-period-secs 1209600
   npx wrangler queues update sales-mail-inbound-dlq --env whispyr --message-retention-period-secs 1209600
   npx wrangler queues update sales-mail-inbound-parking --env whispyr --message-retention-period-secs 1209600
   ```

3. **Secrets**

   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --env whispyr       # SES IAM user (ses:SendEmail)
   npx wrangler secret put AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --env whispyr
   npx wrangler secret put SES_EVENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET --env whispyr
   npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET --env whispyr              # openssl rand -base64 48
   npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL --env whispyr   # e.g. hesham@whispyrcrm.com
   npx wrangler secret put ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_DIRECTORY --env whispyr
   npx wrangler secret put EMERGENCY_FORWARD_TO --env whispyr
   npx wrangler secret put VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY --env whispyr
   npx wrangler secret put VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY --env whispyr
   ```

   `ACCOUNT_RECOVERY_DIRECTORY` is a platform-operator managed JSON object that
   maps each normalized portal email to the user's external recovery email. For
   example: `{"member@whispyrcrm.com":"member@personal.example"}`. Application
   administrators cannot enter or change these addresses. New users remain pending
   until they consume the emailed setup link; claimed users request recovery from
   the sign-in page and receive a generic response that does not reveal account
   existence.
   `AWS_REGION` and `DOMAINS` are plain vars already set in `wrangler.jsonc`.

4. **Deploy** — provisions the Worker and the `mail.whispyrcrm.com` custom domain (the `routes` entry in `env.whispyr`). `CLOUDFLARE_ENV=whispyr` is baked in by the script, so the build resolves the `env.whispyr` block and the deploy lands on the `sales-mail-portal` Worker:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy:whispyr
   ```

5. **Inbound — Cloudflare Email Routing** (dashboard → `whispyrcrm.com` → Email Routing): enable it (accept the MX records), then add a **catch-all** rule that delivers to this Worker.

6. **Outbound — AWS SES** (`eu-west-2`): add `whispyrcrm.com` as a verified domain identity. SES issues 3 DKIM CNAMEs — add them to Cloudflare DNS. Then add:
   - `TXT whispyrcrm.com` → `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com include:_spf.mx.cloudflare.net -all`
   - `TXT _dmarc.whispyrcrm.com` → `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:hesham@whispyrcrm.com`

7. **First admin** — visit `https://mail.whispyrcrm.com/login` and sign in with `ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL` + a password (≥12 chars). With zero users, this bootstraps the first `ADMIN` account and provisions its mailbox. Then create reps at `/admin/users`.

8. **MCP (optional)** - connect through the OAuth flow at `https://mail.whispyrcrm.com/mcp`. A connection can access only the Personal and Shared Mailboxes available to that live user. Mail tools are limited to read, search, and reviewable Draft creation; sending and destructive actions stay in the portal.

## Deploy (production runbook - Wiser environment)

Wiser has its own named Wrangler environment, resources, secrets, SES identity, and DNS/routing sequence. Use [`docs/wiser-go-live-runbook.md`](docs/wiser-go-live-runbook.md) for the exact approval-gated end-to-end launch checklist.
